# Elysium Marketplace

The Elysium Marketplace is an innovative digital platform that leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure and transparent environment where digital creators and collectors can transact seamlessly.

Welcome to the Elysium Marketplace, a blockchain-based platform for creators to sell digital assets and for buyers to acquire unique digital goods using cryptocurrency.

## Features

- **Marketplace**: Browse and purchase digital assets with ease.
- **Creator Dashboard**: Manage your digital assets and view your sales.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and sign-up functionality.
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect your cryptocurrency wallet to buy and sell assets.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Elysium Marketplace, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the Client**

Begin by configuring the client-side application. These steps will install necessary packages and start the React development server, setting up the environment for the Elysium Marketplace user interface.

   Navigate to the `client` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   Start the React development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. **Set up the Server**

The server-side configuration is crucial for handling backend operations of the Elysium Marketplace. Follow these instructions to install Python dependencies and start the Flask server, ensuring the platform's backend is running smoothly.

   Navigate to the `server` directory and install the Python dependencies:

   ```
   cd server
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Start the Flask development server:

   ```
   flask run
   ```

3. **Initialize the Blockchain**

The blockchain is the backbone of the marketplace, storing and validating digital asset transactions. These scripts deploy the necessary smart contracts and populate the marketplace with initial assets, laying the foundational infrastructure for the platform.

   Run the deployment script to deploy smart contracts:

   ```
   node scripts/deploy_contracts.js
   ```

   Initialize the marketplace with initial assets:

   ```
   node scripts/initialize_marketplace.js
   ```
