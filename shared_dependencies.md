Shared Dependencies:

1. **React Components and Hooks:**
   - `useWallet`: A custom React hook likely shared across components that require wallet interaction.
   - `BlockchainContext`: A React context that provides blockchain-related data and functions to the component tree.

2. **TypeScript Interfaces:**
   - `IAsset`: An interface representing an asset, likely imported in multiple components such as `AssetItem.tsx` and `AssetList.tsx`.

3. **CSS Styles:**
   - `globals.css`: Global styles that are applied throughout the React frontend.

4. **Utility Functions:**
   - `blockchain.ts`: Utility functions for blockchain operations, potentially used in various components and hooks.

5. **Python Models:**
   - `Asset`: A database model used in Flask routes for querying asset data.

6. **Python Blockchain Interaction:**
   - `SmartContractManager`: A class that manages interactions with smart contracts, used in Flask routes.
   - `token_management.py`: Contains functions for token-related operations, which might be used across different modules in the backend.

7. **Python API Routes:**
   - `api_blueprint`: A Flask Blueprint object that defines routes for the API, used in `routes.py`.

8. **DOM Element IDs:**
   - `asset-item`: An ID for a div element in `AssetItem.tsx`.
   - `asset-image`: An ID for an img element in `AssetItem.tsx`.
   - `asset-details`: An ID for a div element in `AssetItem.tsx`.
   - `asset-title`: An ID for an h3 element in `AssetItem.tsx`.
   - `asset-description`: An ID for a p element in `AssetItem.tsx`.
   - `asset-price`: An ID for a div element in `AssetItem.tsx`.
   - `asset-purchase-button`: An ID for a button element in `AssetItem.tsx`.

9. **Function Names:**
   - `handlePurchase`: A function in `AssetItem.tsx` that likely triggers the purchase process.
   - `get_assets`: A Flask route function in `routes.py` for retrieving asset data.
   - `purchase_asset`: A Flask route function in `routes.py` for handling asset purchases.
   - `purchase_asset_on_blockchain`: A function in `blockchain.py` that simulates blockchain transaction logic.

10. **Message Names:**
    - `'Purchase successful'`: A success message likely used in both the frontend and backend.
    - `'Purchase failed'`: An error message likely used in both the frontend and backend.

11. **JSON Data Schemas:**
    - Asset JSON schema: `{ id, title, description, price, imageUrl }` used in API responses and frontend state management.

12. **Package Dependencies:**
    - `package.json`: Contains a list of npm packages required by the React frontend.

13. **Python Dependencies:**
    - `requirements.txt`: Contains a list of Python packages required by the Flask backend.

14. **Environment Configuration:**
    - `.env.example`: An example environment configuration file that likely contains necessary variables for both frontend and backend.

15. **Docker Configuration:**
    - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for the Docker environment.
    - `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the Docker image for the application.

16. **Documentation References:**
    - `api_reference.md`: Likely contains references to API endpoints and their usage, shared across the backend and frontend for consistency.
    - `smart_contracts.md`: Documentation on smart contracts that would be relevant to both the `blockchain` module in the backend and the blockchain utilities in the frontend.

17. **Utility Scripts:**
    - `deploy_contracts.js`: A script for deploying smart contracts, which might be referenced in documentation or backend modules.
    - `initialize_marketplace.js`: A script for initializing the marketplace, which might be referenced in documentation or backend modules.

18. **Testing Utilities:**
    - `test_api.py`: Contains test cases for the API routes, which would use shared models and possibly mock blockchain interactions.

19. **Configuration Files:**
    - `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in both frontend and backend.
    - `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the Flask application, which might be shared across various backend modules.

These shared dependencies would need to be consistently implemented and maintained across the entire codebase to ensure that the frontend and backend systems work together seamlessly.
